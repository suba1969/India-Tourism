            Pilgrimage tourism is the type of tourism that entirely or powerfully motivates tourists
            for the achievement of religious attitude and practices. One of the oldest types of visiting the attractions
            and a global experience in the olden times of spiritual growth, it can be differentiated into different
            forms.Thousands of people come to India from all over the world seeking spiritual enlightenment.
            Incidentally,
            most of these pilgrimage sites are tucked away in places blessed with unparalleled natural beauty. In the
            land of
            temples and pilgrimages, we pick the top 10 pilgrimages to take in India.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" id="jagannath"> <b><u>Jagannath Dham:</u></b> The word 'Jagannath' is a combination of two words
            'Jagat' and
            'Natha'. 'Jagat' means 'The Universe/World'
            and 'Natha' means 'Lord/Master'. So the name Jagannath literally means 'Lord of the Universe'. Puri is the
            dwelling place of Lord Jagannath so this place is otherwise known as 'Jagannath Dham' or 'Jagannath Puri'.
            Lord jagannath is the presiding deity of Puri Jagannath Temple. In side the temple He is worshipped with his
            older brother Lord Balabhadra, sister Subhadra and the mighty Sudarshan Chakra (disk). Jagannath is Black
            (inscrutability) in color, Lord Balabhadra is white (enlightment) in color, sister Subhadra is yellow
            (goodness) in color and lord Sudarshan is red in color, hence representing all the four races of world.

            In Sanskrit 'Ja' represents Jagannath, 'Ga' represents Balabhadra, 'Nna' represents Subhadra and 'Tha'
            represents Sudarsan. So Jagannath means the union of all four deities of the Jagannath Temple. His arms are
            parallel, hence willing to embrace the devotees from all over the world and his eyes are round with out any
            eye lids, hence looking after the welfare of his devotees with out any sleep. Everything related to Lord
            Jagannath is Bada (any form of Greatness). He is known as the Bada Thakura (The Chief among all Gods). His
            Temple is known as the Bada Deula (The main temple among the temples). The road in front of the temple is
            known as Bada Danda (Grand Road). The Seaof puri is known as the Mahodadhi (Great Ocean). The cremation
            ground in Puri is known as Swargadwar(The Gateway to Heaven).

        <p align="justify" id="kedharnath"><b><u>Kedharnath:</u></b>Kedarnath is ancient and magnificent temple is located in
            the Rudra
            Himalaya range, is over
            a thousand years old, built of massive stone slabs over a large rectangular platform. Ascending through the
            large gray steps leading to the holy sanctums we find inscriptions in Pali on the steps. The present temple
            was built by Adi Shankaracharya. The inner walls of the temple sanctum are adorned with figures of various
            deities and scenes from mythology. According to legends, the Pandavas sought the blessings of lord Shiva to
            atone their sin after the battle of Mahabharata. Lord Shiva eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing took
            refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bull. On being followed, he dived into ground leaving behind his hump
            on the surface. Outside the temple door a large statue of the Nandi Bull stands as guard.. It is at this
            time, that the doors of the temple are thrown open to pilgrims, who flock from all parts of India, for a
            holy pilgrimage.Kedarnath is amongst the holiest pilgrimages for the devout Hindu. It is set amidst the
            stunning
            mountainscape of the Garhwal Himalayas at the head of the Mandakini River. Kedar is another name of lord
            Shiva, the protector and the destroyer. The shrine of Kedarnath is very scenically placed, and is surrounded
            by lofty, snow – covered mountains, and during summer grassy meadows covering the valleys. Immediately
            behind the temple, is the high Keadardome peak, which can be sighted from great distances. The sight of the
            temple and the peak with its perpetual snows is simply enthralling.

        <p align="justify" id="amritsar"><b><u>Amritsar:</u></b> The Golden temple is located in the holy city of the Sikhs,
            Amritsar. The
            Golden temple is
            famous for its full golden dome, it is one of the most sacred pilgrim spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built
            on a 67-ft square of marble and is a two storied structure. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had the upper half of the
            building built with approximately 400 kg of gold leaf. The Golden Temple is surrounded by a number of other
            famous temples like the Durgiana Temple. The fourth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Ram Das, who had initially
            constructed a pool here, founded Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple or Harmandir Sahib. It is here
            that Sage Valmiki wrote the epic, Ramayana. Rama and Sita are believed to have spent their fourteen-year
            exile in Amritsar, the epicenter of Sikhism. To the south of the temple is a garden, and the tower of Baba
            Atal. The Central Sikh Museum is atop the Clock Tower. The ‘Guru Ka Langar’ offers free food to around
            20,000 people everyday. The number shoots up to 100,000 on special occasions. A visitor must cover his / her
            head before entering the temple premises. The Granth Sahib is kept in the Temple during the day and is kept
            in the Akal Takht or Eternal Throne in the night. The Akal Takht also houses the ancient weapons used by the
            Sikh warriors. Guru Hargobind established it. The rugged old Jubi Tree in the north west corner of the
            compound is believed to possess special powers. It was planted 450 years ago, by the Golden Temple’s first
            high priest, Baba Buddha. Guru-ka-Langar or the communal canteen is towards the eastern entrance of the
            temple complex, and it provides free food to all visitors, regardless of colour, creed, caste or gender.
            Visitors to the Golden Temple must remove their shoes and cover their heads before entering the temple. The
            temple is less crowded in the early mornings on weekends.

        <p align="justify" id="zanskar"><b>Zanskar :</b>There are few places on earth as secluded as Zanskar. Hemmed in
            by the high
            Himalayas on all sides, Zanskar’s inaccessibility, its extreme cold and back-of-beyond location has,
            across centuries, left it cut off from much of what has been happening around the region, and given it a
            Shangri-La-type lure among travellers.But if there’s anyone who would venture into this “Land of White
            Copper”, to Leh’s west, it is the tribe
            of trekkers and hardcore rafting enthusiasts. Because Zanskar is snowed in for much of the year, the
            trekking and rafting season is very short. But if you’re hardy enough – and brave enough – this is a
            journey worth making. The otherworldliness of the landscape will remain with you long after you’ve
            left.Zanskar, save main town Padum, is pretty much as it was when the peripatetic Padmasambhava (or Guru
            Rinpoche, as he was better known), the Indian monk, came passing through in the 8th century. It has its own
            king (though this role is purely ceremonial) but not its own local government – it is administered from
            Kargil. This has often bred resentment in Buddhist Zanskar (Kargil is predominantly Muslim). But Zanskar’s
            remoteness, which has contributed in preserving the area’s unique ethnic character, may soon be a thing of
            the past: a road is being built in the valley, which will connect Padum to Nimmu on the Leh-Kargil road.S

            Ecotourism is entirely a new approach in tourism. Ecotourism is a preserving travel to natural areas to
            appreciate the cultural and natural history of the environment, taking care not to disturb the integrity of
            the ecosystem, while creating economic opportunities that make conservation and protection of natural
            resources advantageous to the local people.In short, ecotourism can be categorised as a tourism programme

            and Where local people are
            benefited." All this together can be called ecotourism. If a travel does not satisfy any one of these

            Karnataka, and is etymologically
            translated to ‘cow’s ear.’ According to popular mythological belief, it is the place where Lord Shiva
            emerged from the incarnation of Mother Earth in the form of a cow. Interspersed with ancient temples, the
            town is home to one of the oldest temples since time immemorial known as Mahabaleshwar, enshrined with Lord
            Shiva. The town is about 59 km from Karwar, 483 km from Bengaluru, and 238 km from Mangalore.

            Furthermore, the rustic outlook of the town has attracted the attention of a lot of travelers and
            foreigners. There are several beaches, pilgrimage sights, and waterfalls that are reverberating tourist
            attractions. In fact, the town is situated around the River Aghanashini, which is considered to be deemed
            and sacred site for devotees.

            However, due to the recent tourist influx, the town attracts both adrenaline seekers and those looking for
            spiritual solace. It is the town of golden beaches named after the way they are shaped like Om Beach and
            Half Moon Beach. Paradise Beach does no injustice to its name! The tall palm trees, serene waves of the
            ocean gushing towards the rocks, and the evenings spent watching the sun melting into the ocean add a
            surrealistic appeal to the place.

            Apart from beaches, there is the Mahabaleshwar Temple that attracts many devotees and saints. Yana is
            another dainty town located in the vicinity of Gokarna, whose lavish surroundings and rocky terrain is
            perfect for activities like cycling and trekking. Mountaineering is another popular sport. <a

            Arunachal Pradesh that lies
            6,000 ft above sea level, surrounded by pine trees and bushes. It is one of the lesser explored valleys in
            this Himalayan region and thus unspoilt. The main attraction is the 400-year-old Samten Yongcha Monastery of
            Mahayana Buddhist sect. It houses numerous ancient statues, including that of Guru Padmasambhava, considered
            to be founder of the Nyingma sect. Colourful costumes and masks created for folklore figures found in
            Tibetan mythology can also be seen. These masks are often worn during a traditional dance called cham, which
            is an energetic and lively event that teaches people to shun all that is dark within them and embrace the
            good tenets of life according to Buddhism, like compassion and love. Many Tibetan festivals, especially
            Losar, are celebrated with reverence. The Losar festival, celebrated to mark the auspicious start of a new
            year, sees a lot of visitors who come to offer prayers. Mechuka is also known for its pristine beauty,
            cultural tribes and gushing rivers that allow for sports like
            kayaking and rafting. The Siang river, which originates from the glaciers around the Mansarovar Lake in
            Tibet, flows through Mechuka and provides a breathtaking view of the valley. There are many bamboo walking
            bridges that connect the banks of this river. Walking on these gently swaying bridges, while the water
            gushes below, can be quite thrilling. Terraced rice fields, dotted with small farms, can be seen on the
            slopes of the valleys in this agrarian belt. Mechuka Valley is home to the people of the Memba, Ramo, Bokar
            and Libo tribes. <a
